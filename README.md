# üé¨ YouTube Downloader UI Pro+

A simple web interface built with Streamlit to download YouTube videos in various formats and qualities. This tool utilizes `pytubefix` and `yt-dlp` for fetching video information and downloading streams, and `ffmpeg` for merging separate video and audio streams for the best quality downloads.

*(Note: The online version runs on shared resources and might have limitations compared to running locally, especially for very long or large files.)*

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Easy URL Input:** Paste any standard YouTube video or shorts URL.
*   **Fetch Video Info:** Displays the video title upon fetching.
*   **Multiple Download Modes:**
    *   **‚ú® Best Quality (DASH Auto):** Automatically selects the highest resolution video and best quality non-Opus audio stream, downloads them separately, and merges them using FFmpeg (Requires FFmpeg).
    *   **‚öôÔ∏è Manual Quality (DASH Manual):** Allows manual selection of specific video and audio streams (adaptive DASH formats) for download and merging (Requires FFmpeg).
    *   **üöÄ Progressive (Simple):** Downloads a single file containing both video and audio (typically up to 720p, no FFmpeg needed).
*   **Download Progress:** Real-time progress bar, download speed, and ETA estimation.
*   **Error Handling:** Provides feedback for invalid URLs, unavailable videos, or download/merge errors.
*   **Filename Sanitization:** Creates safe filenames based on the video title.
*   **FFmpeg Check:** Warns the user if FFmpeg is not detected in the system PATH when required modes are selected.
*   **Dev Container Support:** Includes configuration for easy setup using VS Code Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces.

## üõ† Prerequisites

### Local Setup

*   **Python:** Version 3.11+ recommended (as specified in `devcontainer.json`).
*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **FFmpeg:** **Required** for the "Best Quality" and "Manual Quality" download options which involve merging separate video and audio files.
    *   Download and install from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    *   Ensure `ffmpeg` is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

### Dev Container / Codespaces

*   **Docker:** If using VS Code Dev Containers locally.
*   **VS Code Extension:** [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension if using VS Code locally.
*   Or, simply use **GitHub Codespaces**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Local Environment

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install FFmpeg:** Follow the instructions on the [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for your operating system and ensure it's in your PATH. You can verify by running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal.
    *(On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you might install it via `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`)*

3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2. Using Dev Container / GitHub Codespaces

This is the recommended way for a hassle-free setup, especially if you don't want to install FFmpeg manually.

1.  **Open in Codespaces:** Click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and select "Open with Codespaces".
2.  **Open in VS Code Dev Container:**
    *   Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
    *   Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code.
    *   VS Code should automatically detect the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and ask if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click yes.

The Dev Container setup will automatically:
*   Use the specified Python 3.11 Docker image.
*   Install `ffmpeg` (from `packages.txt`).
*   Install all Python requirements (from `requirements.txt`).
*   Install recommended VS Code extensions (`ms-python.python`, `ms-python.vscode-pylance`).
*   Start the Streamlit application automatically after the container is ready.
*   Forward the necessary port (8501) for you to access the web UI.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit app (if running locally):**
    ```bash
    streamlit run youtube-download-ui.py
    ```
2.  **Access the UI:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (or the URL provided by Codespaces/Dev Containers).
3.  **Paste URL:** Enter the YouTube video URL into the text input field.
4.  **Fetch Info:** Click the "Fetch Video Info" button.
5.  **Choose Option:** Select your preferred download mode (Best Quality, Manual, or Progressive). Configure quality if using Manual mode.
6.  **Download:** Click the corresponding download button.
7.  **Save:** Once the download (and merge, if applicable) is complete, a "Save Video to Your Device" button will appear. Click it to save the file.
